// Purpose: The file defines our Google Protocol Buffers which are used in over 
// the wire messages for the Source engine.

// We care more about speed than code size
option optimize_for = SPEED;

// We don't use the service generation functionality
option cc_generic_services = false;


// 
// STYLE NOTES:
//
// Use CamelCase CMsgMyMessageName style names for messages.
// 
// Use lowercase _ delimited names like my_steam_id for field names, this is non-standard for Steam,
// but plays nice with the Google formatted code generation.  
// 
// Try not to use required fields ever. Only do so if you are really really sure you'll never want them removed. 
// Optional should be preffered as it will make versioning easier and cleaner in the future if someone refactors
// your message and wants to remove or rename fields.
//
// Use fixed64 for JobId_t, GID_t, or SteamID.  This is appropriate for any field that is normally
// going to be larger than 2^56.  Otherwise use int64 for 64 bit values that are frequently smaller
// than 2^56 as it will safe space on the wire in those cases.
//
// Similar to fixed64, use fixed32 for RTime32 or other 32 bit values that are frequently larger than
// 2^28.  It will safe space in those cases, otherwise use int32 which will safe space for smaller values.
// An exception to this rule for RTime32 is if the value will frequently be zero rather than set to an actual 
// time.
